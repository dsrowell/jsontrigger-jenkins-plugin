# Webhook Trigger Plugin for Jenkins

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsrowell/webhooktrigger-jenkins-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dsrowell/webhooktrigger-jenkins-plugin)

Triggers builds based on incoming webhooks with JSON or form data.

## Webhook configuration
Your application should be configured to send all webhook events to
    `$JENKINS_BASE_URL/webhook`
    
Configure your job to be triggered by webhook by specifying a portion of the user agent of the calling application.  For example: 'Stripe/1.0'

## Development
This plugin is built with the [Jenkins Gradle plugin][jpi-plugin].

To start an instance of Jenkins at http://localhost:8080/ with the plugin installed:  
`./gradlew server`

To run the test cases:  
`./gradlew test`

To build the plugin, ready for installation into Jenkins:  
`./gradlew jpi`

The plugin will be written to `build/libs/jsontrigger-jenkins.hpi`.

## Release
### One-time preparation
* You must have a [Jenkins account][jenkins-account]
* Add your credentials to `~/.jenkins-ci.org` in the following form:
```
userName=...
password=...
```

### For each release
To publish a plugin update to the Jenkins update centre:
* Update the top-level `version` property in `build.gradle`
* Commit: `git commit -am "Preparing for release ${VERSION}."`
* Tag: `git tag webhooktrigger-jenkins-plugin-${VERSION}`
* Push: `git push && git push --tags`
* Release: `./gradlew clean publish`

Assuming the Gradle build went well, you can confirm here that the release was uploaded correctly:
http://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/webhooktrigger/

The plugin update should appear in the Jenkins update centre within four to eight hours.
